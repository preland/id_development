"""idc.py must obey a lightweight form of the rules it enforces.

    tools/lint_idcpy.py            report every violation
    tools/lint_idcpy.py --check    exit 1 if the count exceeds the budget

`id` refuses a program whose blocks are long, whose nesting is deep, or whose
functions repeat each other. `idc.py` is the compiler that enforces those rules
and obeys none of them, which is how it reached 5433 lines with a
128-statement function in it. A compiler whose own source is the shape it
rejects is not a good argument for the shape.

The rules are relaxed, deliberately -- Python is not `id`, and demanding three
actions per block would mean rewriting the file into a thousand functions for
no gain. They are set from the file's own distribution: the median function is
9 statements and nests 1 deep, so the limits below are generous to ordinary
code and catch only genuine bloat.

  id                            here                        why relaxed
  3 actions per block           32 statements per function  median is 9
  nesting depth 2               depth 4                     median is 1
  functions must be unique      identical up to renaming    same rule
  3 functions per file          (not checked)               one file, 159 fns

The last one is the interesting omission. It is the rule idc.py breaks worst
and the one that cannot be applied without splitting the file, which is
docs/BACKENDS.md's whole plan. The line ceiling in tests/run.sh covers the
same ground for now.

BUDGET is a ratchet, exactly like that ceiling: it may fall, never rise. The
violations left are named in it, so a NEW one fails even while the old ones
stand.
