# The real standard library, against the real demos.
#
# tests/stdlib.sh builds against tests/fixtures/idstd so it says the same thing
# on a checkout with no library beside it. That makes it hermetic, and it also
# makes it blind: it cannot see that `bin/idc compiler/parse` -- the
# compiler's own source, built the way the README tells you to build it -- fails
# against the real ../idstd on a name the library also defines. Nothing in the
# suite could see that, because tests/run.sh sets IDC_NO_STD=1 for everything.
#
# This file is what sees it. For every project in the repo it records which of
# four states it is in and compares that against tests/idstd_expect.txt:
#
#   both       builds with the library and without it
#   needs-std  builds only with it (it calls a library function)
#   broken     builds only without it -- a collision with the library
#   neither    builds neither way (needs --backend or flags this file does
#              not pass; not a statement about the library)
#
# A mismatch in EITHER direction fails. A new collision fails because the
# ledger says `both`; porting a project onto the library fails until the ledger
# is updated to say so. The ledger cannot go stale and stay green, which is the
# only property that makes it worth having.
#
# `broken` is the work list. It is not a permitted state -- every line saying
# `broken` is a project that has to be ported (C9 in docs/IDSTD.md) or a
# library name that has to move.
#
# Run from anywhere: tests/idstd_real.sh
