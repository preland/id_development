# Three things are checked, and they are different things:
#
#   * the serial port, which is what the kernel says;
#   * the framebuffer, read back through the kernel's own font by

#     only test is its serial output is not a tested graphical shell;
#   * the same `id` source run hosted, on the C runtime, which is what says the
#     `id`-written runtime is *right* rather than merely present.
