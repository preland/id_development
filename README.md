# The `id` language

`id` is a small C-flavored language. This repo contains its first program
(`hello_world.id`) and `idc`, a compiler that transpiles `id` to C and invokes
the system C compiler.

## Quick start

```sh
./idc.py hello_world.id examples/otherfn.id -o hello_world
./hello_world          # usage: ./hello_world <message>
./hello_world hi       # hello world: hi
tests/run.sh           # regression suite
```

A path may be a **directory**, which compiles every `.id` file inside it as one
program; with no `-o`, the output is named after the directory:

```sh
./idc.py demos/adventure    # builds ./adventure from demos/adventure/*.id
./adventure
```

`./idc.py prog.id --emit-c prog.c` writes the generated C instead of building.
All input files (and files found in input directories) are compiled together as
one program.

## Language rules (as stated in hello_world.id)

- **`main` is the entrypoint.** `main(int argc, string[] argv)` receives the
  command-line arguments; its `int` return becomes the process exit code.
- **The `return` clause comes after the function's closing brace** and names
  the returned type: `} return int 0;`, `} return string result;`, or
  `} return void;`. It may reference variables declared in the body.
- **3-action limit per block.** *Every* block — the function body and the body
  of each `if`, `else`, and `while` — may perform at most 3 actions. Each
  statement is one action; an `if` is one and each chained `else` is another; a
  `while` is one. The `return` clause is free. (Bodies are **not** free: a
  branch or loop body has its own 3-action budget.)
- **Maximum nesting depth of 2.** Blocks may nest at most two deep; code below
  that must be split into its own function. Together with the 3-action rule this
  keeps every function shallow and small — deep dispatch is expressed as a chain
  of named functions, not a pyramid of nested branches (see `demos/idc_in_id`).
- **A name keeps one type.** A variable name may be reused across functions, but
  every declaration of it (parameters included) must have the *same* type —
  `i` is always an `int`, `src` always a `string`. Declaring one name with two
  different types anywhere in the program is a compile error. A name is one
  variable *within* a function. (This prevents a vague name like `obj` meaning
  different things in different places, while still letting natural names like
  `i` or `src` recur.)
- **Variables are function-private unless exported.** `export int value = …;`
  declares and publishes a variable; other functions read it with
  `(import value)`. Touching another function's variable any other way is a
  compile error. An exported name is **reserved program-wide**: no other
  variable may use that name — the only way to reach it is `import`.
- **Maximum of 3 functions per file.** Programs grow by adding files, not by
  growing files.

## Rules the example implies (decisions made by this compiler)

These behaviors are visible in `hello_world.id` but never stated; `idc`
resolves them as follows — revisit as the language evolves:

- **`=` in an expression means equality.** Line 23 compares with
  `(import value) = 0`. Since assignment is only a statement form, a bare `=`
  inside an expression is unambiguous and compiles to `==`. (`==` and `!=`
  also work.)
- **Semicolons are optional.** Line 6 omits one. `idc` treats `;` as an
  optional statement terminator everywhere.
- **Functions link across files implicitly.** `testfn()` calls `otherfn()`,
  which no file in the original program defines — and the export/import rule
  is stated only for *variables*. So function calls resolve across all input
  files automatically; a call with no definition anywhere is a warning and
  must be satisfied at link time (see `examples/otherfn.id`).
- **Array literals**: `["hello_world", "hi"]` builds a `string[]`.
- **`+` on strings concatenates**, and a numeric operand mixed with a string
  is converted (`"lucky " + 7` → `"lucky 7"`).
- **Variables are function-scoped, not block-scoped** — `processresult`'s
  `processed` is assigned inside `if`/`else` branches and returned after the
  brace, so declarations are hoisted to function scope.
- **Types**: `int`, `float`, `string`, `void`, and arrays `T[]`. They map to
  C `int`, `double`, `char*`, `void`, and pointers respectively.
- **`print(x)`** is a builtin that prints any value followed by a newline.
- **`input()`** is a builtin that reads one line from stdin and returns it as a
  `string` (the trailing newline is stripped; end-of-input yields `""`). It
  takes no arguments. Branch on the result with ordinary string comparison —
  see `demos/adventure`, a choose-your-own-adventure that selects paths by the
  index the player types.
- **`while (cond) { ... }`** loops while `cond` (an `int`) is nonzero. The loop
  is one action; its body is free, like a branch body.
- **String/IO builtins:** `len(s)` returns a string's length; `charat(s, i)`
  returns the byte code at index `i` (or `-1` past the end); `chr(n)` builds a
  one-character string from a byte code; `read_all()` reads all of stdin into
  one `string`; `to_int(s)` parses a string to an `int`. Together with `while`
  these make text processing possible — see `demos/idc_in_id`, a lexer for `id`
  **written in `id`**.
- **Growable lists.** A `T[]` is a heap-allocated, growable list with
  **reference semantics** — passing one to a function and mutating it is visible
  to the caller (this is how `id` gets shared mutable state). Operations:
  `[a, b, c]` builds a list and `[]` makes an empty one (in a typed context);
  `xs[i]` reads an element and `xs[i] = v` writes one; `push(xs, v)` appends;
  `len(xs)` is the length. An AST or symbol table is built as a few parallel
  lists indexed by an integer id — see `demos/idc_in_id/BLOCKERS.md`.

## The compiler

`idc.py` is a self-contained Python program: lexer → recursive-descent parser
→ semantic checks (action limit, function-per-file limit, global name
uniqueness, export/import access, light type checking) → C emission → `cc`.

Generated code details:

- `id` functions are prefixed `id_` in C (so `id` `main` becomes `id_main`,
  wrapped by a real C `main`). Exported variables become C globals.
- A file set without a `main` compiles to a `.o` object file for later linking.
- String concatenation allocates and never frees; fine for now, a real
  runtime would need ownership rules or GC.
